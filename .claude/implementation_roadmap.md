# Weft Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the phased development of the Weft deterministic concurrency testing framework. Each milestone delivers working functionality that builds toward the complete vision.

---

## 🎯 Milestone 1: Core Foundation
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Goal**: Establish the foundational scheduler and virtual time system

### Success Criteria
- Basic scheduler can spawn and coordinate tasks deterministically
- Virtual time advances only at controlled points
- Examples run with deterministic behavior (same seed = same result)
- Type compatibility issues resolved

### Key Deliverables
- ✅ **PRNG Implementation**: Fast, high-quality deterministic random number generator
- ✅ **Scheduler Engine**: Task spawning, cooperative scheduling, deterministic selection
- ✅ **Virtual Time**: Logical clock that advances at yield points
- ✅ **Task Context**: Proper context implementation with yield support
- ✅ **Type Fixes**: Resolve signature mismatches between stubs and implementation

### Dependencies
- None (foundational work)

### Validation
- `examples/counter_test.go` passes with deterministic results
- Same seed produces identical task scheduling across runs
- Virtual time advances predictably

---

## 🔒 Milestone 2: Synchronization Primitives
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Goal**: Implement deterministic mutex, condition variables, and channels

### Success Criteria
- Mutexes block/unblock deterministically with proper waiter queues
- Condition variables support deterministic wakeup selection
- Channels handle send/receive/close operations deterministically
- All examples demonstrate correct synchronization behavior

### Key Deliverables
- ✅ **Deterministic Mutex/RWMutex**: Waiter queues, lock ownership, spurious wakeup simulation
- ✅ **Condition Variables**: Wait/Signal/Broadcast with deterministic waiter selection
- ✅ **Deterministic Channels**: Buffered/unbuffered with deterministic sender/receiver selection
- ✅ **Scheduler Integration**: Primitives properly yield control and integrate with task scheduling

### Dependencies
- Milestone 1 (scheduler and task management)

### Validation
- `examples/bank_test.go` detects deadlocks reliably
- `examples/queue_test.go` shows consistent producer-consumer behavior
- `examples/worker_pool_test.go` demonstrates condition variable coordination

---

## 🕵️ Milestone 3: Advanced Detection & Debugging
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Goal**: Add deadlock detection, timeout handling, and trace recording

### Success Criteria
- Deadlock detection identifies circular waits and stuck systems
- Configurable timeouts prevent infinite test runs
- Trace recording enables detailed failure analysis
- Replay system reproduces exact failure scenarios

### Key Deliverables
- ✅ **Deadlock Detection**: Identify when no tasks can progress
- ✅ **Timeout Detection**: Configurable limits on test execution time and steps
- ✅ **Trace Recording**: Capture sequence of scheduling decisions and operations
- ✅ **Trace Replay**: Reproduce exact execution from recorded traces
- ✅ **Environment Configuration**: `WEFT_*` variables for runtime control

### Dependencies
- Milestone 2 (synchronization primitives)

### Validation
- Deadlock tests correctly identify and report circular waits
- Timeout mechanisms prevent runaway tests
- Trace replay produces identical results to original runs

## 🧪 Milestone 4: Testing & Production Readiness
**Timeline**: 2 weeks
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and documentation

### Success Criteria
- 90%+ test coverage across all components
- Performance benchmarks show minimal overhead in production mode
- Complete documentation with migration guides
- All examples work correctly in both modes

### Key Deliverables
- ✅ **Test Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- ✅ **Performance Benchmarks**: Measure overhead in both modes
- ✅ **Documentation**: API docs, migration guides, troubleshooting
- ✅ **Example Validation**: All examples demonstrate intended behavior
- ✅ **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages and debugging info

### Dependencies
- Milestone 3 (core functionality complete)

### Validation
- All tests pass in both deterministic and production modes
- Performance impact in production mode is negligible
- Documentation enables successful adoption

## 🚀 Milestone 5: Extended Features & Tools
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Goal**: Advanced features for production adoption

### Success Criteria
- Trace shrinking produces minimal failing reproductions
- Multiple scheduling policies available for different testing strategies
- weftfix tool automates code migration
- CI/CD integration enables systematic testing

### Key Deliverables
- ✅ **Trace Shrinking**: Automated reduction of failing traces to minimal cases
- ✅ **Scheduling Policies**: Round-robin, bounded exploration, fairness options
- ✅ **weftfix Tool**: Automated code transformation with safety checks
- ✅ **CI Integration**: Templates and guides for systematic exploration
- ✅ **Property-Based Integration**: Coordinate with fuzzing and property testing

### Dependencies
- Milestone 4 (stable foundation)

### Validation
- Shrinking reduces complex failures to simple reproductions
- Multiple scheduling policies reveal different bug classes
- weftfix successfully migrates real codebases
